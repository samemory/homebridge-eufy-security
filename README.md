Hello,

We have included many features between 1.0 and the new 1.1 (current beta branch).

Many settings have been moved/reorganized. It is recommended to delete your current configuration and start from scratch. A good time to see all the changes we've made to the user interface.

By the way, it seems that some of the UI changes are cached, which can cause problems. We recommend that you clear your web browser's cache before opening an issue.

In addition, we will be moving the github repo to a new organization. We haven't heard from Sam and some of the Github features are off-limits to us because we have a contributor status.

Beta updates will now be pushed from the new repository.
Within 2 weeks, we will port the beta to stable. This will be done from the new repo. The switchover should be transparent. We will lose all issue history. A message on the homepage will be present to inform.

Here is the new URL: https://github.com/homebridge-eufy-security/plugin

Greetings,
The Homebridge Eufy Security Team
